## :snake: Python programming
**Institution:** Université Paris Cité  
**Role:** Supervisor for practical work (L1)  
**Semesters:**  
- Fall 2021 (September - December)  
- Fall 2022 (September - December)  

I led first-year MIASH (Applied Mathematics for Social Sciences) students through foundational Python programming. The course was aimed at developing their skills in data analysis, providing them with practical experience in applying Python to real-world problems.

## :coffee: GUI projects in Java
**Institution:** Université Paris Cité  
**Role:** Supervisor for practical work (L2)  
**Semester:** Spring 2022 (January - June)  

In this course, I guided groups of 5-6 second-year computer science students through Java-based GUI projects I wrote, <a href="{% link /assets/pdf/teaching/22-01-AlignSeq.pdf%}">AlignSeq</a> and <a href="{% link /assets/pdf/teaching/22-01-PhyloApp.pdf%}">PhyloApp</a>. Advanced students progressed to a <a href="{% link /assets/pdf/teaching/22_02_fusion_projets.pdf%}">fusion project</a> combining elements from both initial projects in collaboration with another group. This challenged students to merge their solutions, enhancing their application and integration skills in bioinformatics software development.

## :file_folder: Database management systems
**Institution:** Université Paris Cité  
**Role:** Supervisor for practical work (L3)  
**Semester:** Spring 2023 (January - June)  

This course equipped third-year computer science students with essential skills in database creation, maintenance, and SQL. Through practical work, students delved into database modeling, relational algebra, and SQL queries optimization. The curriculum was designed to integrate theoretical knowledge with practical applications, enabling students to manage and operate complex database systems effectively.
