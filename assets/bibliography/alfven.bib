	abstract = {Ion heating by Alfvén waves has been considered for long as the mechanism explaining why the solar corona has a temperature several orders of magnitude higher than the photosphere. Unfortunately, as the measured wave frequencies are much smaller than the ion cyclotron frequency, particles were expected to behave adiabatically, impeding a direct wave-particle energy transfer to take place, except through decorrelating stochastic mechanisms related to broadband wave spectra. This paper proposes a new paradigm for this mechanism by showing it is actually much simpler, more general, and very efficient. Indeed, for measured wave amplitudes in the quiet corona, ion orbits are shown to cross quasi-periodically one or several slowly pulsating separatrices in phase space. Now, a separatrix is an orbit with an infinite period, thus much longer than the pulsation one. Therefore, each separatrix crossing cancels adiabatic invariance, and yields a very strong energy transfer from the wave, and thus particle heating. This occurs whatever be the wave spectrum, even a monochromatic one. The proposed mechanism is so efficient that it might lead to a self-organized picture of coronal heating: all Alfvén waves exceeding a threshold are immediately quenched and transfer their energy to the ions.},

interaction: neo-adiabatic view of the problem.},

  abstract={This is the intership report for my master 1. This article provides a new vision of the heating of ions in the solar corona through Alvén waves. Except the introduction which gives a brief overview of the solar corona problem and some references of the existing literature, the following tries to be more pedagogical with the description of Alvén waves and the complete derivation of the Hamiltonian of a test particle. The neo-adiabatic theory is introduced through the pendulum in a slowly time-modulated gravity field before it is applied to the Alfvénic Hamiltonian. Last part suggests a self-consistent explanation for energy transfer and heating of ions in the solar corona.},
