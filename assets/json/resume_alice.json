To make use of these valuable data, I developed two knowledge graphs, OntoTox and ChemoOnto. These graphs organize data on chemotherapy treatments and toxicities, facilitating comparisons between theoretical treatment protocols and actual patient outcomes. I created the ProtoDrift metric to quantify deviations in chemotherapy protocols, thus refining adherence assessments. I validated ProtoDrift through survival analyses, showcasing its potential in advancing precision oncology research.","highlights":["Knowledge graph","Survival analysis","Statistical learning","Text mining"]},{"name":"Inserm - Paris Georges Pompidou hospital","position":"Research engineer","startDate":"2019-11-01","endDate":"2020-11-30","summary":"I took part in the QualiHealth project aimed at improving the quality of healthcare data.
