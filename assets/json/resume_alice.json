Clinical data warehouses hold important information about chemotherapies and their effects, but it’s often scattered and hard to interpret. To make use of this valuable data, I developed two knowledge graphs called OntoTox and ChemoOnto. These graphs helped me organize and analyze the information effectively. Using these frameworks, I compared standardized and actual chemotherapy regimens. Leveraging these comparisons, I am currently working on predicting chemotherapy responses.",
