Hello! I am Alice Rogier, a PhD candidate in the collaborative Inserm-Inria [HeKA team](https://team.inria.fr/heka/fr/). My research focuses on the detection and prediction of chemotherapy responses using Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

In other words, my work mines the vast and diverse data provided by today's clinical data warehouses to better understand and predict how patients react to their chemotherapy treatments. This involves transforming routine medical data, such as narrative reports, laboratory results, and software records, into valuable insights that can guide treatment decisions.

During my PhD, I have made two significant contributions to the field:
* I developed graph representations, [ChemoOnto](https://zenodo.org/records/10548491) (and its [reuse](https://hal.science/hal-04455155)) and [OntoTox](https://inria.hal.science/hal-03364585), which organize and integrate knowledge about chemotherapies and their responses, making this information more accessible and useful for research.
* I developed ProtoDrift metric, which measures chemotherapy adherence more accurately than traditional methods by accounting for deviations in treatment schedules and dosages. This metric is currently being evaluated through survival analysis (work in progress).

As I approach the completion of my PhD, I am eager to continue contributing to academic research in this vital area of healthcare.

Thank you for visiting my site, where I share updates on my research and explorations at the intersection of data science and healthcare.
