![image]({% link /assets/img/logos/medinfo21_logo.png %}){: style="float: right; margin: 4px;" height="70 px"} The paper I submitted to the [Medinfo21](https://imia-medinfo.org/medinfo21/) conference was strongly accepted :sparkles:! Save the date, October 2-4: I will talk about *Using an Ontological Representation of Chemotherapy Toxicities for Guiding Information Extraction and Integration from EHRs*. Cherry on the cake: the paper I co-wrote with Alexandre was also selected. He will talk about the *Design of an Ontology-Based Triage System for Patients with Chronic Pain*.
