I recently returned from Bordeaux :wine_glass: where I tested ProtoDrift :snowboarder:, my newly developed metric for measuring chemotherapy adherence, on a different patient population. A big thank you to the [IAM team](https://www.chu-bordeaux.fr/Les-unit%C3%A9s-m%C3%A9dicales/Informatique-et-archivistique-m%C3%A9dicales-(UIAM)/) for their welcome and support. We're validating the algorithm in a new context, with promising early results. Stay tuned for a detailed paper coming soon!
